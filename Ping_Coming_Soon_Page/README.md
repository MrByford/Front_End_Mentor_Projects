## My process

### Built with

- SCSS / SASS
- Grid
- Flex
- Semantic HTML Markup
- Google Fonts
- JS

### What I learned

I have learned how to .createElement and use .parentNode to create error messages dynamically. I have also learned how to implement the removal of the present error message when a correct input has been detected. 

### Continued development

Keep on practicing with js and expanding my knowledge in order to build more dynamic and behavioral websites.
