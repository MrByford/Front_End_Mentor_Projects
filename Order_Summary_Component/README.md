### What I learned

Again while doing this project I haven't particularly got any takeaways from it, its again embedding my coding knowledge and being able to achieve a design from a mockup and make it responsive. This in itself is important to my coding journey. 

### Continued development

The continued development for myself would be to continue progressing through these challenges and move onto some with more complex structures and languages.
